# Autoload Directory

This directory contains scripts that should be set as autoload/singletons in the Godot project settings.

## Scripts

These scripts should be added to Project Settings > Autoload:
- scripts/managers/GameManager.gd - As "GameManager"
- scripts/managers/AudioManager.gd - As "AudioManager"
- scripts/managers/UIManager.gd - As "UIManager"
- scripts/managers/SaveLoadSystem.gd - As "SaveLoadSystem"

Note: Add these through the Godot editor's Project Settings > Autoload panel, not by moving files here. This folder serves as documentation.
